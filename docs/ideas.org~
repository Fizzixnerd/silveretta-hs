* Silveretta Ideas
The main idea behind Silveretta is experimentation.  I want to
experiment with a Lisp that I can modify myself.

** Experiements

*** How much syntax can be added to Lisp before it stops being Lisp?
I want Silveretta to have some convenience syntax that can be extended
by users easily.  However, I'm not sure how far I can go with this
"syntactic sugar" without ruining the essential qualities that make
Silveretta a Lisp.

An example: classical Lisps have their `let' forms defined so that
they look something like this:

(let ((var1 val1)
      (var2 val2)
      ...
      (varn valn))
  <body>)

But this makes it ugly to use let on a single variable:

(let ((var val))
  <body>)

So I want to make it more easily readable via this syntax:

(let
  (var1 <- val1)
  (var2 <- val2)
  ...
  (varn <- valn)
  <body>)
